Ans 1 The relationship between the “Product” and “Product_Category” entities is established through a foreign key. In the “Product” table, there is a field named category_id which acts as a foreign key that references the id field in the “Product_Category” table. This means that each product is associated with a category. The category_id field in the “Product” table points to the id of a specific category in the “Product_Category” table, indicating what category the product belongs to. This allows for organizing products into different categories and is useful for queries where you might want to retrieve all products within a certain category.
Ans 2 To ensure that each product in the “Product” table has a valid category assigned to it, we would use a foreign key constraint. Foreign Key Constraint: When you define the category_id field in the “Product” table as a foreign key that references the id field in the “Product_Category” table, the database management system (DBMS) will enforce referential integrity. This means that any category_id entered into the “Product” table must exist as an id in the “Product_Category” table. Not Null Constraint: Additionally, you can apply a NOT NULL constraint to the category_id field to ensure that every product must have a category_id value upon insertion, which means it cannot be left empty. Cascade Delete/Update: If a category is deleted or its id is changed in the “Product_Category” table, you can define cascading behaviors on the foreign key to automatically update or delete corresponding entries in the “Product” table to maintain consistency. By implementing these constraints and behaviors, we can ensure that all products have a valid category assigned and maintain data integrity within your database.
